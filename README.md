I'm Kirti Arora(Kiko), a curious developer exploring the realms of code and creativity. 

🔭 Currently, I'm on a mission to create innovative solutions and bring ideas to life.

💡 I believe in the power of simplicity and elegant design, and I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies.

⚡ Fun fact: Coffee fuels my coding adventures, and I'm always up for my script of javascript!

🌈 Join me as I embark on this exciting journey, one line of code at a time.
